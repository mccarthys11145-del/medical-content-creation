## Step 1: Initial Presentation

### Patient Scenario
**Meet Sarah, 45-year-old marketing executive**

*"I've been having chest pain for the past 2 hours. It started while I was in a stressful meeting and hasn't gone away. The pain feels tight and heavy, like someone is sitting on my chest. I'm scared it might be a heart attack."*

**Initial Vital Signs:**
- Blood pressure: 165/95 mmHg (elevated)
- Heart rate: 102 bpm (elevated)  
- Respiratory rate: 22 breaths/min (slightly elevated)
- Temperature: 98.6°F (normal)
- Oxygen saturation: 98% on room air

### Your First Impression

**Choose your initial assessment priority:**

**Option A:** This sounds like a heart attack - order emergency cardiac tests immediately
- *Click to continue with cardiac workup pathway*

**Option B:** Need more history first - chest pain has many causes
- *Click to continue with systematic history taking*

**Option C:** Vital signs suggest anxiety - consider panic attack
- *Click to continue with anxiety/psychiatric evaluation*

---

## Step 2A: Emergency Cardiac Pathway

### If you chose Option A (Emergency cardiac workup)

**You immediately order:**
- 12-lead EKG
- Cardiac enzymes (troponin)
- Chest X-ray

**Results Available:**
- **EKG:** Normal sinus rhythm, no acute ST changes
- **Troponin:** <0.01 ng/mL (normal)
- **Chest X-ray:** Clear lungs, normal heart size

### Critical Thinking Moment

**The tests are normal, but Sarah is still having pain. What now?**

**Option A1:** Discharge home - tests are normal, not a heart attack
- ⚠️ *Potentially dangerous - may miss other serious causes*

**Option A2:** Admit for observation and serial cardiac enzymes
- ✓ *Safe approach, but may be unnecessary if other causes likely*

**Option A3:** Step back and get more detailed history
- ✓ *Good clinical reasoning - initial tests help, but history is key*

---

## Step 2B: Systematic History Pathway

### If you chose Option B (Detailed history first)

**You systematically gather more information:**

**Pain Characteristics:**
- **Location:** Central chest, radiating to left arm
- **Quality:** "Heavy, tight, crushing"  
- **Timing:** Started 2 hours ago, constant
- **Triggers:** Stressful meeting, no exertion
- **Relief:** Nothing has helped so far

**Associated Symptoms:**
- ✓ Sweating (diaphoresis)
- ✓ Nausea  
- ✗ Shortness of breath
- ✗ Palpitations
- ✗ Dizziness

**Risk Factors Assessment:**
- **Age:** 45 (moderate risk)
- **Gender:** Female (lower risk pre-menopause)
- **Family history:** Father had heart attack at 60
- **Smoking:** Non-smoker
- **Diabetes:** No
- **High cholesterol:** Yes, on medication
- **Hypertension:** Yes, poorly controlled

### Differential Diagnosis Consideration

**Based on this history, rank your concern level:**

**High Concern (immediate workup needed):**
- Acute coronary syndrome
- Aortic dissection  
- Pulmonary embolism

**Moderate Concern (evaluate but less urgent):**
- Gastroesophageal reflux
- Anxiety/panic disorder
- Musculoskeletal pain

**Lower Concern (consider after ruling out serious causes):**
- Costochondritis
- Viral syndrome
- Medication side effects

## Step 3: Diagnostic Testing Decision

### Based on Sarah's History and Risk Factors

**Her risk factors include:**
- Family history of coronary artery disease
- High cholesterol
- Poorly controlled hypertension  
- Typical chest pain characteristics
- Associated symptoms (sweating, nausea)

### Choose Your Diagnostic Strategy

**Option 1: Immediate Rule-Out Protocol**
- EKG, chest X-ray, troponin
- If normal, discharge with follow-up
- *Fast, cost-effective, but may miss some cases*

**Option 2: Comprehensive Workup**
- Full cardiac evaluation including stress testing
- CT angiogram to rule out aortic dissection
- D-dimer for pulmonary embolism
- *Thorough but expensive, may find incidental findings*

**Option 3: Risk-Stratified Approach** ⭐ *Recommended*
- Initial EKG and troponin
- Risk score calculation (HEART score)
- Further testing based on risk level
- *Evidence-based, balanced approach*

---

## Step 4: Test Results and Clinical Reasoning

### Your Risk-Stratified Results

**HEART Score Calculation for Sarah:**
- **History:** Moderately suspicious = 1 point
- **EKG:** Normal = 0 points  
- **Age:** 45-65 years = 1 point
- **Risk factors:** 2+ factors = 2 points
- **Troponin:** Normal = 0 points
- **Total HEART Score:** 4 points

**Risk Interpretation:**
- Score 0-3: Low risk (0.9-1.7% 30-day cardiac events)
- **Score 4-6: Moderate risk (12-16.6% 30-day cardiac events)** ← Sarah's risk
- Score 7-10: High risk (50-65% 30-day cardiac events)

### Clinical Decision Point

**With moderate risk (HEART score 4), what's your next step?**

**Option A:** Further cardiac testing recommended
- Stress testing or cardiac CT angiography
- Serial troponins over 6 hours
- Cardiology consultation

**Option B:** Discharge with outpatient follow-up
- Primary care follow-up in 24-48 hours
- Return precautions for worsening symptoms
- Risk may be acceptable for outpatient management

**Option C:** Shared decision-making with patient
- Explain risks and benefits of each approach
- Consider patient preferences and circumstances
- Document discussion and rationale

## Step 5: Resolution and Learning Points

### The Outcome

**Following shared decision-making, Sarah chose further testing:**

**Stress Test Results (next day):**
- **Exercise stress test:** Positive for ischemia
- **Echocardiogram:** Wall motion abnormality in LAD territory
- **Follow-up:** Urgent cardiology referral

**Cardiac Catheterization:**
- 85% stenosis of left anterior descending artery
- Successful PCI (stent placement)
- Excellent outcome

### Key Learning Points

**✅ What Worked Well:**
- Systematic history taking
- Risk stratification using validated tools
- Shared decision-making with patient
- Evidence-based approach to testing

**⚠️ Potential Pitfalls Avoided:**
- **Premature closure:** Assuming anxiety without proper evaluation
- **Over-testing:** Unnecessary tests for truly low-risk patients  
- **Under-testing:** Missing moderate-risk patients who need evaluation
- **Poor communication:** Not explaining uncertainty and options

### Clinical Pearls

**For Healthcare Providers:**
- Chest pain evaluation requires systematic approach
- Risk stratification tools improve decision-making
- Patient preferences matter in moderate-risk scenarios
- Documentation of reasoning protects patient and provider

**For Patients:**
- Chest pain evaluation is complex and takes time
- Multiple tests may be needed to ensure safety
- "Normal" initial tests don't always mean "go home"
- Your symptoms and concerns are important in decision-making

### Try Different Scenarios

**Interactive Elements:**
- **Restart simulation** with different choices
- **Age/gender variations:** How do demographics change risk?
- **Symptom modifications:** What if pain was sharp vs. crushing?
- **Risk factor changes:** Impact of diabetes, smoking, family history
