# Hypertension Treatment Protocols: Clinical Practice Summary

**Evidence-based guidelines for optimal blood pressure management**

## Classification and Diagnostic Criteria

### BP Classification (2017 ACC/AHA Guidelines)
- **Normal:** <120/80 mmHg
- **Elevated:** 120-129/<80 mmHg  
- **Stage 1 HTN:** 130-139/80-89 mmHg
- **Stage 2 HTN:** ≥140/90 mmHg

### Diagnostic Requirements
- Minimum 2 readings from ≥2 separate occasions
- Standardized measurement protocols with validated devices
- Out-of-office monitoring for white-coat/masked hypertension confirmation
- Ambulatory BP monitoring when indicated

## Risk Stratification and Treatment Thresholds

### ASCVD Risk Assessment
Utilize Pooled Cohort Equations for 10-year ASCVD risk calculation. Initiate pharmacotherapy based on:

**High-Risk Patients (≥130/80 mmHg threshold):**
- Clinical ASCVD
- Diabetes mellitus
- Chronic kidney disease
- Age ≥65 years
- 10-year ASCVD risk ≥10%

**Lower-Risk Patients (≥140/90 mmHg threshold):**
- No CVD
- 10-year ASCVD risk <10%

## Treatment Targets

### Standard Targets
- **General population:** <130/80 mmHg
- **Diabetes/CKD/CAD:** <130/80 mmHg
- **Adults ≥65 years:** <130 mmHg systolic

### Special Considerations
- Monitor for orthostatic hypotension in elderly patients
- Secondary stroke prevention: initiate at ≥140/90 mmHg in drug-naïve patients

## Lifestyle Interventions

### Primary Recommendations
- **Sodium restriction:** <1,500 mg/day or ≥1,000 mg reduction
- **Potassium supplementation:** 3,500-5,000 mg/day (if no CKD)
- **DASH diet:** Emphasize fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins
- **Physical activity:** 90-150 minutes/week aerobic exercise
- **Weight management:** BMI <25 kg/m²
- **Alcohol moderation:** ≤2 drinks/day (men), ≤1 drink/day (women)
- **Smoking cessation**

## Pharmacological Management

### First-Line Agents
Initiate with one of four preferred classes:
1. **ACE inhibitors** (lisinopril, enalapril)
2. **ARBs** (losartan, valsartan)
3. **Thiazide/thiazide-like diuretics** (chlorthalidone, HCTZ)
4. **Calcium channel blockers** (amlodipine, nifedipine XL)

### Combination Therapy Indications
- BP >20/10 mmHg above target
- Stage 2 hypertension
- Black patients (consider initial two-drug therapy)
- Single-pill combinations preferred for adherence

### Agent Selection Considerations
- **Beta-blockers:** Not first-line unless compelling indication (CAD, HF)
- **Avoid:** Dual RAAS blockade (ACE + ARB)
- **Black patients:** Thiazide diuretics or CCBs preferred as initial therapy

## Secondary Hypertension Screening

### Clinical Clues
- Resistant hypertension (uncontrolled on ≥3 agents)
- Onset <30 years or >55 years
- Severe hypertension (≥180/110 mmHg)
- Target organ damage disproportionate to BP elevation

### Common Causes
- Primary aldosteronism (screening: aldosterone-to-renin ratio)
- Sleep apnea
- Renal artery stenosis
- Pheochromocytoma
- Drug-induced (NSAIDs, decongestants, steroids)

## Monitoring and Follow-up

### Initial Phase
- Follow-up within 1 month of therapy initiation
- Assess BP response, adherence, side effects
- Titrate medications every 2-4 weeks until target achieved

### Maintenance Phase
- Quarterly visits once stable
- Annual laboratory monitoring (BUN, creatinine, electrolytes)
- Home BP monitoring encouraged
- Annual cardiovascular risk reassessment

## Special Populations

### Elderly Patients (≥65 years)
- Careful BP lowering to avoid orthostatic hypotension
- Consider frailty status in treatment decisions
- Monitor cognitive function
- Start low, go slow with medication adjustments

### Chronic Kidney Disease
- Target <130/80 mmHg
- ACE inhibitors or ARBs preferred
- Monitor serum creatinine and potassium
- Referral to nephrology if eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73m²

### Diabetes Mellitus
- Target <130/80 mmHg
- ACE inhibitors or ARBs first-line
- Thiazide diuretics or CCBs as add-on therapy
- Avoid beta-blockers if hypoglycemia unawareness

## Quality Metrics and Outcomes

### Performance Measures
- Percentage of patients with BP <140/90 mmHg
- Percentage of high-risk patients with BP <130/80 mmHg
- Medication adherence rates
- Time to goal BP achievement

### Expected Outcomes
Following 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines may prevent up to 610,000 CVD events annually compared to previous guidelines. Cost-effectiveness demonstrated through reduced hospitalizations and improved quality-adjusted life years.

## Implementation Considerations

### Healthcare System Factors
- Team-based care models improve outcomes
- Clinical decision support tools enhance guideline adherence
- Population health management platforms for monitoring
- Quality improvement initiatives for systematic BP control

### Patient Factors
- Shared decision-making for treatment goals
- Cultural competency in care delivery
- Health literacy assessment and education
- Social determinants of health screening
